This is where it all started. Here we introduce the
[msprime](/software/msprime.html) coalescent simulator and
the core algorithms and data structures that would later
be separated out into [tskit](software/tskit.html).
Read this paper if you would like to find out more about
coalescent simulation, or to understand the core tree sequence
algorithms and theoretical results. _Note:_ much
of the terminology has been updated since this original publication
as the models were generalised.
