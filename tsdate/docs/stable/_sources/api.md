# APIs

_Tsdate_ provides two APIs

* A [Python API](sec_python_api) and
* A [command line interface](sec_cli).

The Python API is more flexible, but the CLI can be useful for dating
large tree sequences outside of a interactive python session, for running _tsdate_ on a
remote server, etc. Both are formally documented in the following pages.
