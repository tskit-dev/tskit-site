        Start here if you're new to tree sequences. This paper introduces
        <a href="/tsinfer.html">tsinfer</a>, the method to infer tree sequence
        topologies from genetic variation data.
        Please see the
        <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/458067v1">preprint</a>
        if you cannot access the Nature Genetics paper.

        This paper shows that we can think about any statistic that works on
        sequence data in an equivalent (and more powerful) way in terms of the
        underlying trees, and that we can compute these statistics very efficiently.
        Read this paper if you would like more technical details on how the
        underlying data structures work and an introduction to incremental
        tree sequence algorithms.

        Forwards-in-time simulations are very flexible but also usually very CPU
        intensive. This paper shows how we used tree sequences to make
        forwards-in-time simulations both more efficient and even more flexible.

        Continuing on from the 2018 PLOS Computational Biology paper,
        we discuss here how the tree
        sequence recording method was implemented in the powerful
        <a href="https://messerlab.org/slim/">SLiM</a> simulator. We
        show how some simulations are orders of magnitude more efficient
        and examples of the new possibilities that keeping a full
        record of the genetic ancestry makes available.

        This is where it all started. Here we introduce the
        <a href="/msprime.html">msprime</a> coalescent simulator and
        the core algorithms and data structures that would later
        be separated out into <a href="/tskit.html">tskit</a>.
        Read this paper if you would like to find out more about
        coalescent simulation, or to understand the core tree sequence
        algorithms and theoretical results. <b>Note:</b> much
        of the terminology has been updated since this original publication
        as the models were generalised.
