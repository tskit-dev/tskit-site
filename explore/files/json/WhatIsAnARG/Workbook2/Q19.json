        {"answer": "Span decreases (gets shorter)", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct: older haplotypes will have gone through more recombination events, and so the genomic region passed to the current-day samples will have been whittled down in length"},
        {"answer": "Span increases (gets longer)", "correct": false},
        {"answer": "Span stays about the same", "correct": false}
