# Community

The software projects listed on this site are all open-source and built by contributors,
most of whom are users and researchers in the field.

New contributors are always welcome! 

## Questions, bugs and suggestions

Discussion about features, bugs and releases of tskit-dev software happen 
on the github repo for each project, see the links on the [software page]({% link software.md %}).
Please open an issue if you have a concrete bug report or feature.

For support using the software, or for more general questions, please use the

## Discussion and meetings
